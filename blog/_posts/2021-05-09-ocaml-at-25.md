On this day in 1996, Xavier Leroy [announced Objective Caml 1.00](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/1996-05/msg00003.html) (the language wasn’t officially called OCaml until [4.00.0 in July 2012](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2012-07/msg00179.html)). I wouldn’t start using OCaml for another 7 years; I think I may have dropped Research Machines Basic by then and was mucking around with a mix of Visual Basic, Turbo Pascal and Delphi, but I hadn’t yet got an email address either.

For whatever reason, the `1.00` tag deletes the boot images, but they can be taken from the [commit before](https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/tree/2de35753f7b43b11098f7d25a09b8cb904c1a2ca/boot). I could get the runtime to build quite easily on Ubuntu, but alas while it appeared to be able to run `boot/ocamllex`, `boot/ocamlc` was just segfaulting. I debated firing up my old dual-Pentium III which apparently had Slackware 10 on it, but I thought I’d give the Windows port a go first!

According to the docs, the Windows compiler used to be bootstrapped with a different set of binary images, but this didn't actually seem to be necessary, apart from changing [2 backslashes to forward slashes in f70db6e](https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/commit/f70db6ec87f2008caeb00d59defa9b4f914a4683). The sources for the GUI weren't open, so it’s necessary to [disable the graph library in 3262c4](https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/commit/3262c4c90cc395c7dec94deb8a732ced70ccf0e9) and make [some very minor tweaks to the install target in c9ad1c](https://github.com/dra27/ocaml/commit/c9ad1c2a509bdb7032a6778c2113cdb441df185f) and that was it!

You’ll need an x86 Visual Studio build environment with Cygwin in `PATH`.

```
git clone https://github.com/dra27/ocaml.git -b 25-years-of-ocaml ocaml-at-25
cd ocaml-at-25/config
copy s-nt.h s.h
copy m-nt.h m.h
cd ..
nmake -f Makefile.nt world
nmake -f Makefile.nt opt
nmake -f Makefile.nt install
set PATH=C:\ocaml\bin;%PATH%
```

There are a lot of warnings to ignore, but you should now have a working Objective Caml 1.00!

```
C:\Birthday>ocaml.exe
Objective Caml version 1.00

#print_endline "Happy 25th Birthday, OCaml!";;
Happy 25th Birthday, OCaml!
- : unit = ()
##quit;;
```

and the native compiler should work too:

```ocaml
let rec hip_hip n =
  if n > 0 then
    let () = print_endline "hip hip! hooray!" in
    hip_hip (pred n)

let () = hip_hip 25
```

```
C:\Birthday>ocamlopt -o hooray.exe hooray.ml

C:\Birthday>hooray
hip hip! hooray!
...
```

Here’s to the next 25 years!
