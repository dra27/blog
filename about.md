David Allsopp’s working life is paired between being a Research Associate at [OCaml Labs](http://ocamllabs.io) in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk)’s [Faculty of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk) and a [countertenor](http://www.davidallsopp.com) of moderate renown.

This blog addresses the first element of that pair.
